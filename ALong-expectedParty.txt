Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announces that he will be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday 
with a party which greatly excites the Hobbits of Hobbiton. Bilbo is rich and described as very peculiar, 
and had been a wonder in the Shire for his disappearance and unexpected return. The riches in which he brought 
along with him is regarded as a local legend and it is believed that the tunnels of Bag End is full of treasures.

( Bilbo became rich through his adventure as a hired "burglar" for Thorin
Oakenshield and his band of 13 Dwarves. The Dwarves were on a quest to reclaim
the Lonely Mountain along with its treasures from the dragon Smaug. In the
end, the band were able to defeat Smaug and Bilbo got his cut of the treasure
making him immensely wealthy for a hobbit. )

And if that were not enough for fame, there is also his prolonged vigor to marvel at.
Time work on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same
as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been
nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads nad thought this was too much of a good thing; 
it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustaable wealth.
