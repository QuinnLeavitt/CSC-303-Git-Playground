W ithout Fail
E veryone will cry once in a while
E verything will be ok someday
P robably doesn't feel like it now
I f you are hurting
N o matter what, you are loved
G ood thing is, there is always someone in  your corner

W ithout worrying too much about tomorrow
I t is important to just get thorugh the day sometimes
L ife is a lot of ups and downs
L ove can make all the difference
O verall, just the process eventually there
W ill be a day when it gets easier

P lease don't take this as life advice, its
O nly an acrostic poem about weeping willow trees
E ven if theres something that helps, it
M ight not all be what you need.

(Well, I tried my best for a more serious poem... I am not a poet)
